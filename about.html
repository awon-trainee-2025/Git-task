        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Deema Bakhyer, an enthusiastic Computer Science student eager to gain hands-on experience through co-op
            opportunities in the IT field. I possess strong technical skills, including programming in Java, Python, and
            SQL, as well as UI/UX development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

            I stand out for my creative thinking and teamwork abilities, demonstrated through various programming
            projects such as a Clinic Management System and a Pharmacy System. Additionally, I have achieved notable
            success in competitions, including securing second place in the "Occupational Health and Safety Hackathon."

            I am committed to continuously enhancing my technical and interpersonal skills through active participation
            in student activities and volunteering. I am also highly proficient in English.</p>
