    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! my name is Roba I’m a Computer Science student with a strong interest in front-end development and UI/UX design. I enjoy creating clean, intuitive interfaces that make digital experiences feel smooth and enjoyable.

        While front-end is where I feel most creative and confident, I’ve also been exploring the basics of back-end development to better understand how things work behind the scenes. I love learning through building and experimenting, even if it gets a little messy sometimes!
        
        I’m also curious about cybersecurity and game development, and I’m always open to discovering new areas in tech.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>

I’m always eager to apply what I learn in practical, creative ways.</p>
